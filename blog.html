      <!-- question 3 -->
      <div>
        <h1>3.What is event loop? How does it work?.</h1>
        <p>
          Event loop is a runtime model for javascript. Actually event loop
          execute javascript code.It collect event and process then execute in
          queue one bye one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Event loop is a continuous process for the call stack for functions to
          execute.Event loop is callback queue for pending task.After the call
          stack is empty, the event loop take the next task from the callback
          queue and adds it to the call stack.Then task is executed, and any
          additional functions called by that task are added to the call stack.
          When the task is completed execution, they are removed from the call
          stack, and the event loop continues to check for additional tasks in
          the callback queue.
        </p>
